    p Welcome to <span class='accented'>#{title}</span>, a simple web application designed to get you out of your seat and on your feet. Prolonged sitting even for as little as one hour, damages the health of our blood vessels, and over time increases our risk of cardiovascular disease. Standing, stretching, or taking a short walk every 15-45 minutes can help to lessen the damaging effects of sitting.
    br
    p <span class='accented'>#{title}</span> will help improve your health by reminding you to get up and move through the power of your favorite songs. Unlike boring or annoying alarm reminders, OfficeBeatz, we hope, will facilitate a fun, energizing environment in your workplace, all while improving your health!
